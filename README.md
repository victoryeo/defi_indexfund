This is an early prototype of DeFi indexed fund. It is designed to track a mixture of tokens and stocks. It tracks minimum two tokens/shares, maximum eight tokens/shares. It is composed of price oracles + smart contracts.

The smart contract source code is in src/contracts folder.
The smart contract test code is in test/ folder.

Run "truffle compile" to compile the smart contracts.
Run "truffle test" to test the smart contracts.

The code is tested with Ganache. The idea is inspired by balancer.
